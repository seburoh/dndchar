Backstory:Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down And I'd like to take a
minute just sit down, James I'll tell you how I became the undisputed King of Card Games. In
northeastern Africa, born and raised in the palace was where I spent most of my days chilling out
max and relaxin' all the while or playing some card games right beside the Nile When a couple of
guys, who were up to no good starting making trouble in my neighborhood! I got in one little fight
and the gods got scared they said "You're moving in with Yugi and his Grandpa downstairs!" I wound
up in Japan, and things were less clear like I couldn't kill folks for losing card games here! If
anything, I could say that this place is lame but I thought, "Nah, forget it, I'll play some card
games!" I bought card game booster packs, seven or eight, and I yelled at the old man "Yo, Homes,
smell ya later!" Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there to sit on my throne with my ridiculous
hair.
